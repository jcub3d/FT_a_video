I was reading about Magnetic Resonance Imaging when I learned about k-space.

k-space is essentially a place to store time domain data, and there's high-symmetry
and stuff, and it looks all fuzzy and jumbled.  

To get the actual MRI image, a 2d fourier transform is performed on
the k-space matrix.

I had the idea to write a program to convert a video to k-space (sort of invert
the process).  What I'm doing is kind of analogous, but not really.

The FT performed four times on a given image should result in the same image.
Testing with my program showed that this is sort of the case, but there's a 
superimposed inverted image displayed.

The included video here is NOT that example, but is an example where the 
NORMALL option is set to True.  I did this initially (incorrectly - I should have
only normalized at the end), but it had a sort-of neat result.
